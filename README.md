# Digit Recognition powered by Neural Network 

## Emulates real-time digit scanning from text files filled with 1 and 0 inputs that replicate handwirtten digit markings 

## Implementation Methodologies and Tools: 
* Modeled Neural Network (Input Layers, Hidden Layers, Output Layers, Perceptrons)
* Forward Propagation and Back Propagation Algorithms to train model 
* Math: Sigmoid function, Error Summation, Threshold Comparison
* Python math and random Libraries
  
## How to install and run:

* Run neural.py file in folder that also has SampleData.txt and ValidationData.txt files
* Text files can be adjusted to change the training or validation of model prediction
